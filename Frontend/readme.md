## React vs. React Native
| |React|React Native|
|-|-----|------------|
|**What is**|A **front-end** development library. Also known as *ReactJs*, a JS library for building the UIs for **web apps**|A native **mobile** development library. To build **mobile UI** declarative components using only JS. React Native utilizes the base abstraction of ReactJs, but only the library components are distinct.|
|**Difference**|1. Uses virtual DOM to create UX<br>2. Integrate React library in HTML page<br> 3. Execute apps ont he client-side while rendering on the server-side<br> 4. Must learn and understand JS<br> 5. Render HTML-like (JSX) components with \<p>, \<div>, \<h1> <br> 6. Uses local storage to store and manage data|1. Uses APIs to render UI components<br> 2. Mast have development environment like Android Studio and Xcode<br> 3. Can integrate native codes with JAva, Swift, Objective-C<br>4. Combines JAva, Objective-C, Objective-C++ and C++ code<br> 5. Render native components like \<view>, \<text>, \<images> <br> 6. Uses asyncStorage by default|
|**Pros**|Easy learning curve<br> Reusable components<br>Virtual DOM|Easy to learn and implement<br> Reusable code<br>Fewer errors|
|**Cons**|Few native modules|Long load time|
